## Matrix inversion is usually a costly computation and there may be some benefit to caching the inverse of a matrix rather than 
## computing it repeatedly. These functions create a special matrix object that can cache an inverse. 

## This function creates a special "matrix" object that can cache its inverse.

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {
        inv     <- NULL
        set     <- function(y) {
                x <<- y
                inv <<- NULL
                }
        get <- function() x
        setInverse <- function(inverse) inv <<- inverse
        getInverse <- function() inv
        list( set = set,
        get = get,
        setInverse = setInverse,
        getInverse = getInverse)
                
}


##  This function computes the inverse of the special "matrix" returned by makeCacheMatrix above. If the inverse has already been
##  calculated (and it has not been changed), then it should receive the inverse from the cache. 

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
        inv <- x$getInverse()
        if (!is.null(inv)){
                message("getting cached data")
                return(inv)
        }
        m <- x$get()
        inv <- solve(m, ...)
        x$setinverse(inv)
        inv
}
